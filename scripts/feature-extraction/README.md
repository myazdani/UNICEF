# SkiCaffe

SkiCaffe is a wrapper that provides a "scikit-learn like" API to pretrained networks such as those distributed in the Caffe Model Zoo or elsewhere (such as DeepDetect). Basically, I wanted to use these pretrained models for extracting features, but also use the powerful pipelines of scikit-learn. Here we illustrate it's basic use for extracting features.

Follow this notebook for an example on how to extract features:
